# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I feel confident in using them, and have not memorized too many. It is nice
to know there are resources out there.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
Using def and creating my own simple methods is going better than earlier today.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
I am still a little confuse on when we use the return command?
